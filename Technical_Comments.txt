Dwelling selection to remove bias from model

Step 1 : Produce a summary of all the houses

Step 2: Select the first subset of houses based on

      a) no_of_days of data available ( needs to be at least 1 year to reflect seasonality)

      b) less than 2 days HH missing ( or shall we do this as a percentage of total available points instead)

      c) less than  10 zeros ( or shall we do this as a percentage of total available points instead)

Step 3 : Selecting groups ( consider all ACORN classes, discount the ones with less than 50 houses or merge groups

Step 4: Matching start and end dates  for each group

Step 5: Averaging for each timestamp for each group by with and without outliers
